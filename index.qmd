## Introduction

This report outlines the methodology behind forecasting the outcome of the upcoming Icelandic Parliamentary Elections scheduled for November 30th. The forecast is based on a dynamic linear model implemented in Stan, incorporating polling data over time and adjusting for polling house effects.

## Model Specification

We model the polling percentages for each political party over time using a dynamic linear model with a multinomial observation component. The model captures the evolution of party support and accounts for variations between different polling houses.

### Notation

- $P$: Number of political parties.
- $D$: Number of time points (dates).
- $H$: Number of polling houses.
- $N$: Number of observations (polls).
- $y_{n,p}$: Count of responses for party $p$ in poll $n$.
- $\beta_{p,t}$: Latent support for party $p$ at time $t$.
- $\gamma_{p,h}$: Effect of polling house $h$ for party $p$.
- $\sigma_p$: Scale parameter for the random walk of party $p$.

### Dynamic Party Effects

The latent support for each party evolves over time following a random walk:

$$
\beta_{p,1} = \mu_{p}, \quad \beta_{p,t} = \beta_{p,t-1} + \epsilon_{p,t} \quad \text{for } t = 2, \dots, D+1,
$$

where $\epsilon_{p,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_p^2 \times \Delta_t)$, and $\Delta_t$ is the time difference between polls at $t-1$ and $t$.

### Polling House Effects

Polling house effects are modeled to account for biases:

$$
\gamma_{p,1} = 0, \quad \sum_{h=1}^{H} \gamma_{p,h} \approx 0,
$$

where election results are assigned to the the first polling house and therefore the first polling house's effect is set to zero. A soft sum-to-zero constraint is applied to the remaining effects to allow for small amounts of industry-level bias.

## Data and Likelihood

The observed counts $y_{n} = (y_{n,1}, \dots, y_{n,P})$ are modeled using a multinomial distribution with a logit link:

$$
y_{n} \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(  \sum_{p=1}^P y_{n, p}, \text{softmax}\left( \eta_{n} \right) \right),
$$

where $\eta_{n} = (\beta_{1, t_n} + \gamma_{1, h_n}, \dots, \beta_{P, t_n} + \gamma_{P, h_n})$, $t_n$ is the date of poll $n$, and $h_n$ is the polling house of poll $n$.

## Prior Distributions

The priors are specified as follows:

- Initial party effects: $\beta_{0,p} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.
- Random walk innovations: $\epsilon_{p,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_p^2 \times \Delta_t^2)$.
- Polling house effects: $\gamma_{p,h} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, with $\sum_{h} \gamma_{p,h} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{house}} \sqrt{H - 1})$ as a soft constraint.
- Scale parameters: $\sigma_p \sim \text{Exponential}(1)$.

## Inference

Bayesian inference is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via Stan. Posterior distributions of the latent variables $\beta_{p,t}$ and $\gamma_{p,h}$ are obtained, allowing for probabilistic forecasting of election outcomes.

## Posterior Predictive Checks

To assess the model's fit, posterior predictive simulations are conducted:

$$
y_{\text{rep}, d} \sim \text{Multinomial}\left( n_{\text{pred}}, \text{softmax}\left( \beta_{:, d} \right) \right), \quad d = 1, \dots, D+1.
$$

These simulations generate replicated data under the model to compare with the observed data.

## Conclusion

The dynamic linear model effectively captures the temporal evolution of party support and adjusts for polling house biases. By leveraging Bayesian methods, we obtain a comprehensive probabilistic forecast of the election outcomes, accounting for uncertainty in the estimates.
